# CMPT 353 Final Project - Project Topic: Sensors, Noise, and Walking

- Collect 3D accelerometer data using Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite 
- Conduct noise filtering using a Butterworth filter
- Conduct a Fourier transform to get the frequency of steps
- Perform data analysis on possible report topics

## Possible Questions

- How does walking pace (steps/minute or similar) differ between people? Does it vary by age, gender, height, â€¦?
- Calculate walking speed (m/s) from just the accelerometer? How accurate can you get? Can you then determine differences between subjects as above?

## How to use
Libraries:
- Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SciPy 

```
$ python3 TEMP.py
```
