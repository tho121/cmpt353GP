# CMPT 353 Final Project - Sensors, Noise, and Walking

- Collect 3D accelerometer data using Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite 
- Conduct noise filtering using a Butterworth filter
- Conduct a Fourier transform to get the frequency of steps
- Perform data analysis on possible report topics

## Project Focus

- In this analysis we attempt to predict the userâ€™s height based on 3D accelerometer data alone

## How to use
Libraries:  Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SciPy 

Step 1: Clean the raw datasets and save into a 'clean data' folder
```
$ python3 data_clean.py
```
